Main Repo Yay

How to Run what we have so far: (It features a React component that is automatically transpiled by Babel to help be supported on a browser. We need to set up more CSS and get more react components together.)

# To Run the Project Right Now

Go to the file location of the repo on your pc. Then type this in the console:
'''
httpster -d ./dist -p 3000
'''
The project should be running on localhost:3000. We are going to make this a little different later on (following the tutorial at least)
